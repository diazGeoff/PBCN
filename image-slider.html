                        <li>Breast cancer won't be fatal for as long as it stays restricted to one's breast - a non-vital organ. Only when the cancer spreads (metastasizes) to a life-sustaining organ (lungs, liver or brain) does the cancer become life-threatening.</li>
                        <li> Breast cancer takes many forms and affects each woman differently. Some cancer will never spread beyond the breast or metastasize to vital organs and some will. However, patients more than often receive full and similar treatments no matter what type  their individual cancer is.</li>
                        <li>At the time of diagnosis, it can not be determined with certainty whether or not one's breast cancer will be life-threatening. It is next to impossible to know who will benefit from surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and who will not - leaving patients with more questions than answers about their treatment options.</li>
                        <li>Many cases of breast cancer after surgery do not require chemotherapy and radiation. Reducing the risk of recurrence or metastasis can be achieved through non-toxic means. In fact, chemotherapy  can cause damage to healthy cells which triggers them to secrete a protein that sustains tumour growth and resistance to further treatment</li>
