                        Established in 28 August 1997 by the late Rosa Francia-Meneses, the Philippine Breast Cancer Network is the country's leading not-for-profit volunteer service network focused on identifying the environmental causes of breast cancer for the prevention, early intervention and ultimate eradication of the disease.  The PBCN carries the voices of people affected by breast cancer to inspire and compel the changes necessary to end the breast cancer epidemic.

                    <p>
                        Less than 10 percent of breast cancers are genetic, and science increasingly points to environmental factors in the sharp rise of breast cancer incidence. For this reason, the PBCN has adopted the bold mission to eliminate the environmental causes of the disease, including toxic chemicals and radiation. Through public education, trainings, policy initiatives, outdoor challenges and other innovative campaigns, the PBCN mobilizes the public to secure the changes needed to stop this devastating epidemic.

                    <p>
                        In response to the public health crisis of breast cancer, the PBCN with valuable and reliable information from The Breast Cancer Fund and Breast Cancer Action (both from the USA) identifies – and advocates for elimination of – the environmental and other preventable causes of the disease. The PBCN works from the knowledge that breast cancer is not simply a personal tragedy, but a public health priority that demands action from all.

                        The Philippines has the 12th largest population and the 11th highest incidence rate of breast cancer in the world. Our country experienced the world’s highest increase in breast cancer incidence from the year 1980 to 2010 and today, the chances of women getting breast cancer is 1 in every 13.
